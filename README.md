# Detecting and Defending Against Adversarial Attacks
7th semester project.  
For the black-box attack and keyword spotter used in this project see https://github.com/nesl/adversarial_audio  
For the white-box attack used in this project see https://github.com/carlini/audio_adversarial_examples  
When running the code use DeepSpeech 0.9.3, Tensorflow-gpu 1.15.4, PyTorch 1.13.1+cu116, CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.5.  
For the pre-trained diffusion model DiffWave the officially provided checkpoints is used and linked here: https://github.com/philsyn/DiffWave-unconditional/tree/master/exp/ch256_T200_betaT0.02/logs/checkpoint?fbclid=IwAR3MX0AMM7h8e-FIyF1EXJhVPI64AJAej61FVL_CicVCNABxJKx1MxRKUN8
