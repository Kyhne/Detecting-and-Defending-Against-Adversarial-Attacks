This folder contains an adversarial speech dataset for white-box attacks. Both normal and adversarial examples are included and they are equal in numbers. This dataset was built upon Mozilla Common Voice dataset (available at https://voice.mozilla.org/en/datasets), which is under the Creative Commons license (available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Therefore, this adversarial speech dataset is under the same license.
